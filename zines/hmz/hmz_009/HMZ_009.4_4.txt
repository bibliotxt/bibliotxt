<TeNoiR> hi robshot!
<TeNoiR> rob, isn't yer page www.robshot.com ?
<robshot> yes
<robshot> www.robshot.com
<TeNoiR> btw, do u mind if i ask u a couple of questions?
<robshot> not at all
<TeNoiR> who invented minidvd and supervcd?
<robshot> supervcd is industry standard... promoted and supported by the China government
<robshot> to compete with DVD, while still staying on CD (650mb) format (for low price)
<robshot> no support from hollywood nor dolby, so they use open format audio type... mpeg2 audio
<robshot> as for miniDVD.... wink wink..... i cannot claim to have invented it.. but I did started the buzz over this community ... though I believe a lot of "real dvd author" have been asking the same thing before..
<TeNoiR> what u mean with real dvd author?
<TeNoiR> i remember that u started the project
<TeNoiR> but u mean ppl tryng to blaim on someone about minidvd?
<robshot> no no no...
<robshot> i mean, there is a good chance that some dvd-author have tried making this before (and failed)...
<robshot> i don't mean that ppl tryin to blame on someone about miniDVD
<robshot> i've been lucky to have people helping me with email describing their results 
<TeNoiR> so, how came the idea to make a minidvd and for what?
<robshot> Basically, I love movie trailers. So, when I started collecting dvds, I thought about having a collection of trailers on a disc in its original dvd-quality format.
<robshot> There was also a thing about dvd menu being so bad (take those star trek discs for example, lousy menu/graphics) that made me want to create my own menu for my trailer collections
<robshot> Then I started to look for information about making dvd, but storing it on CDR. It was tough to get such info in mid 97 :)
<robshot> But I managed to get some, and find some demo software authoring... and started this thing that I called miniDVD. I don't know if other people have "coinned" that "miniDVD" term.
<TeNoiR> so minidvd is on regular CDRs ?
<robshot> Then it grows from collecting trailers, to making my home video miniDVDs, converting music video I taped over MTV, and some tv series that I captured off broadcast for my own collection. Suddenly, I have no need of blank VHS tapes anymore :)
<robshot> Yes, miniDVD is DVD-VIDEO format stored on regular CDRs, thus with the limitation of 650mb or 700mb data capacity.
<TeNoiR> what about the quality compared with regular dvds?
<robshot> if you use the dvd-specifications, it is comparable. The main issue is the source video to make it, and the length of time for such high-quality video to be stored on a normal CDRs
<TeNoiR> so, how long could be a movie, using minidvd way?
<robshot> Again, it depends on the bitrate of your video. I have managed to have a 51 minutes of video with very nice quality, but also it can go as low as 25 minutes if you use like 6-7Mbps mpeg2 video.
<TeNoiR> if i want to backup a dvd that i own, can i use minidvd method?
<robshot> Definitely. But then you might need 3-6 discs to hold them... Not a good choice. Remember, I started with trailer collections, then on to music video, home video and episodic tv series...
<TeNoiR> on your opinion, minidvd is an excelent way to collect music videos, for those that don't have all the necessary equipment or knowledge?
<robshot> miniDVD is excellent not only for average home user, to collect music videos, but also for the artists themselves.
<robshot> You see, what if an Album is released, and it is accompanied with a "cheap" CD containing a miniDVD of 1 or 2 music videos as a promotional disc?
<TeNoiR> what does an average home user need to create a minidvd (hardware and software) ?
<robshot> As for home user, well, as dvd-authoring is getting easier and easier nowadays (I'm talking about those easy authoring softwares), I believe people with a good video capture board and a cd-burner can do it.
<robshot> That's the hardware requirements you need to create your own music videos from MTV :). As for the purpose of back-up your dvds that have music videos (like Austin Power dvd with Madonna's music videos), you don't need a capture card. Just a DVD-ROM Drive.
<TeNoiR> what about the software needed?
<robshot> To create miniDVD? I believe CDMOTION series is not expensive. Also Sonic DVD-IT LE, or DVDQUickAuthor, or DVD-WISE..
<robshot> you were asking for software = authoring software, right?
<TeNoiR> all the software that a normal user needs to create a minidvd...
<robshot> Yes, those are the software(s) needed by normal users to create a miniDVD. And a CD-R burner/sofware of course :)
<TeNoiR> no premiere, or other video editors?
<robshot> Well, if you want some spice and banana splits :)... But if its a matter of simple video, I don't see any need for those video editors. Virtuadub will help (simple video editing (cut/paste))
<TeNoiR> what if i want to create a minidvd from some trailers from a dvd that i own?
<TeNoiR> what about protection and zones...etc ?
<robshot> I know that some "utilities" exists to copy the trailers from DVD to harddrive.
<robshot> When you talk about zones, if you make your miniDVD all zone, that'll fix the problem
<robshot> Such kind of utilities will help you achieve your goal.
<robshot> Like that deCSS utility, and other that have sprung over after the buzz in November :)
<TeNoiR> where can be found those utilities?
<robshot> Because of that famous trial in USA, these utilities are getting harder to find on the internet. But putting a right word on a search engine will bring you to some places that have these renegade utilities :)
<TeNoiR> are there any tutorials, guides or faqs that could be found to help ppl to make a good minidvd?
<robshot> Yes. Again, using a search engine and a right word search will bring you to the rare page(s) on the internet that contains a tutorial/how to for making miniDVDs or SVCDs :)
<TeNoiR> are they hard to find or do you know any of these sites?
<robshot> the famous pcdvd page has it. And Doom9 page has it. Mine does :)
<TeNoiR> do u mind on giving us those URLs?
<robshot> http://dvd.da.ru, www.robshot.com, http://go.to/doom9 for example(s)
<TeNoiR> is illegal the use of those utillities, even if i own a dvd?
<robshot> If you're asking my opinion, I'd say I can do anything with a DVD that I buy with my own money :)
<robshot> except making money out of it.
<robshot> So, I can step on my own DVD, throw it into the lake, break it, or copy the trailers and make my own miniDVD of trailer collections :)
<TeNoiR> what is the purpose of your page?
<robshot> To let people know the beauty of DVD, and also help the "creative" ones to make their own DVD, or miniDVD, and also SVCD or VCD along the way :)
<TeNoiR> could those tutorials be found on your page?
<robshot> You bet :)
<TeNoiR> are they easy to understand for a newbie?
<robshot> I'd say they are
<TeNoiR> what about processor, video adapter, ram and sound card minimum requirements  for making it?
<robshot> With the current standard of PCs (re RAM, processor, Video Adapter), I think everything will be fine for miniDVD authoring! :)
<TeNoiR> is there any channel on an irc server where ppl could ask for some help?
<robshot> Yes.. as a matter of fact. If you go to EFNET, join the channel #pcdvd where people talk and discuss about these things, 
<TeNoiR> do u mind if your name is mentioned in the article or your webpage?
<robshot> I don't mind. It's a creative page, so I'm not trespassing anyone's fence IMHO
<TeNoiR> thanx for your time and hope that u can help us in the future with more  info, if you don't mind....
<robshot> no problem. Glad to be of help to you :)
<TeNoiR> btw, would you like to add something on what u said or say something to the ppl who wants to start following your guide...
<robshot> I'd say, start collecting miniDVDs :) but buy DVDs. Don't bother ripping movies, just make your homevideo, the "rare" trailers and music videos... :)
<TeNoiR> any other suggestions or tips?
<robshot> miniDVD is not for the light-hearted. But Mpeg2 quality is worth it! 
* robshot that's about all i can say, TeNoiR :)
<TeNoiR> thanx, rob!!! 
<TeNoiR> interview finished =)
<TeNoiR> c ya and thanx
<robshot> your welcome, my friend :)
